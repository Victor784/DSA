# DSA
Data structures and algorithms implementation meant for a better understanding. This library is a header only library at the moment.
The DSs should be templatizited. Please note that if you need to refactor / extend the lib you should also refactor / extend and 
run the tests to be sure that the functionalitty is not broken.

# HOW TO USE 
1. Clone the repo
2. Run configure.sh
3. Run build.sh
4. in DataStrucutres/lib you should have the headers

5. If you need to extend the library
  5.1. Add .hpp and .cpp files with the buissness logic
  5.2. Run the configure.sh and build.sh scripts again

6. If you need to refactor any file
  6.1. Refactor the necessary files
  6.2. Run the build.sh script again

# Data structures 
The following data structures should be / will be implemented using C++ : 
1. Dynamic Array - done 
2. Linked list(singly/doubly) - done
3. Stacks
4. Queue
5. Table
     5.a Hash table 
     5.b Symbol table
     5.C Lookup table
6. Binary trees
   6.a Binary search trees
   6.b Balanced trees
7. Heaps
8. Priority Queue
9. Graph
10. Trie
11. Matrix
12. String

# Algorhitmhs
The algorithms implemented are / will be :
1. Binary search 
2. Find shortest path in graph
3. Navigate labyrint 
4. TBD
